### Introduction:

In this exciting project, I'm delving deep into the world of some of the top **YouTube data analyst content creators** in my opinion, that I follow and learn from. My mission is to uncover their winning strategies for captivating the right audience and understand how these strategies shape their results.

### Dataset:
I'll be tapping into the YouTube API to gather the necessary data for my analysis. This adventure involves obtaining channel IDs and fetching video IDs from these channels. For each video, I'll be focusing on these key attributes:

- Number of views
- Number of Likes
- Number of Comments
- Category ID
- Description
- Video duration
- Publishing Date

### Data Processing:
Before I dive into the analysis, I've meticulously transformed each data field into the appropriate format:

- Views are now integers
- Likes are now integers
- Comments are now integers
- Video duration is in float format
- Publishing date is in datetime format*

### Engagement and Views:
It's not just data; I'm measuring user engagement and scrutinizing the comments-to-likes ratio. Additionally, I'm keeping an eye on the average monthly views to understand the monthly viewership each content creator garners.

### Analysis Video  Counts and Duration:
My journey takes me into the realm of video counts and duration.

### Publishing Strategy:
Here, I aim to decipher how content creators optimize their content.

### Analysis of Tags, Titles and Words ranked by views:
In the quest for insights, I'm unraveling the mysteries behind tags and titles. By identifying the most frequently used tags, I will gain valuable insights into the most used words in video titles that got content creators more viewerships.

### Data Analyst Content creators in view:
